#Introduction

###“This wants to be outside the cage of the age” 
–Mission of Burma from the song “This is Not a Photograph” (1981)


##How did Justin and I come to choose this type of Data and Visualization?
We started this process by branching out and looking for data that was relevant or interesting to us.  We looked at Statistics Canada and Comic Book charts. Ultimately, while the information was interesting, we found that it was difficult to find data that was formatted to fit RAW’s needs.

While trying to figure out how to most effectively put data into RAW (to get the best visualization results), I was thinking about data in my life and what data would be interesting to see of other people.  Counting and categorizing the types of pictures currently in my phone is where I landed.  I thought this would be an interesting array of data to see visualized because between Justin and I, it is a smaller data set to work with, which can easily be interpreted, and it is also something that I think is very relevant to DH.  By looking at what types of pictures are currently in our phones, we our defining our lives and ourselves by those pictures.  For example, Justin had categories like “Art” that I did not have even though the categories were broad.  This shows that our perception and intent of picture taking is very different.  In all of my 1,533 pictures, I had no intent to take them for art and even now, I do not see any of my pictures as art.

These charts we chose visualize in colour and size the bulk of pictures we have in each category. The Clustered Force Layout chart in Raw was the best graphing tool to comparatively show the quantities and volumes of the images we make, versus common charting factors like dates and times. Most of the other charts required some sort of date variable that we did not record in our data. The chart we chose was ideal among the templates offered to us. In the future, we would consider customizing a template that could include a variety of variables. However, at this stage in the development of our mutual research, this visualization allowed us to create the best single possible static illustration of trends occurring within hundreds of images. 

##Alex’s Reflection on our process
I had 1,533 photos in my phone.  These photos represent my life from December 2013 (when I first got my phone) to the present.  What this specifically shows about me in relation to Justin (as you will read below) is that I do not like to delete anything.  I really like to hold onto things and keep them in the same place.  The only pictures that are absent from my phone are specific memories I did not want to keep and technically inadequate pictures. I have a high volume of photos kept on my device because I have a Windows Nokia phone that is not always compatible in offloading images to my Apple laptop.  So when I have tried to dump my photos into my computer, I’ve had issues, but, having access to them was useful for this analysis. 

In trying to gather data from this I realized that I had to be introspective to be able to categorize these photos.  To some extent, I still do not think all of these photos were categorized 100% accurately because some straddle multiple categories.  In having to put photos into a specific group, I was forced to judge the photo based on the intention of the picture when it was taken.  For example, pictures in the “Photos of the Me” category are pictures that are only of me; however, pictures in the “Photos of Friends” and “Photos of Family” categories may have me in them.  This is because I feel that the intention of taking the picture is to capture a moment with friends or family and not of me.  I think that this collection of data was a vey interesting project because it incorporated us into the assignment and we were able to see ourselves (our data) visualized.  

When trying to create the graph, I realized that a lot more information could be gained by including dates into the data collection to see what was important during certain times in my life.  For example, “Photos of Pets” takes up the bulk of my photos but if I had organized by date you would have seen that this only happened after Feb 2015 when I got my puppy.  Before that “Photos of Family” had the most photos followed closely by “Photos of Friends”.

##Justin’s Reflection on our process
When my colleague Alex Nahas and I decided to break down the content of what the latest iTunes software titles our photo into data we could…re-visualize…it quickly became clear that our photos were significant windows into our selves. Diaristic or journal-like in their description of lives, we did a brief corporeal analysis of the cultural text produced in the greatest volume by the devices we used most frequently.

One thing distinguishing my file of images from hers was that I had nearly ten times less (158 pictures). Given the storage capacity of my phone, this is small change for someone who is on Instagram perpetually and considers himself a photographer with experience publishing and exhibiting photos. However, I’m often offloading photos to my computer to leave room for a new glut of images I might produce. It’s an organizational compulsion necessary in order to have some semblance of control over possible volume. Earlier this year I resided in London, Ontario, where I actively photographed the post-industrial east end neighbourhood I lived and worked in. My black and white series Of the Trade had taken over my phone and needed to be stored elsewhere, lest it become victim to loss, water damage of some other common phone death. Reflecting on this margin between limitations and opportunity in the technology I most commonly utilize to photograph was in turns valuable and alarming to realize the vulnerability of what I produce. 

What has taken its place is a new phase of images documenting a new phase my life. While creative work remained (read: election night photos of CBC TV coverage stalling and pixelating on the slow live feed of a big-screen TV (Mulcair’s face digitally smeared)), a survey of the landscape of my new bungalow-centric suburban neighbourhood bordering the city of Nepean was emerging, captured on walks with my dog Sonny. And there were many portraits of him, maybe more than the humans in my life, which was maybe a bit troubling but also just a sign of new kinship patterns. Pets, so many social observers argue in our transforming environment of social norms, are gradually people too. GIFs also emerged as someone new players within my image library. A childhood friend and I who live hours apart often relate to one another in pop culture memes, which has made animated GIFs of moments from the Simpsons and Seinfeld our language of choice. It truly conveys something no phone call or verbal quip can.

More than just a textual analysis, sorting through my camera roll was chance to survey the field of myself and conduct a bit of auto-ethnography; a short bit of fieldwork on my phenomenological experience of intra-provincial migration, artistic habitus and the value of GIFs as inter-personal language. In some of the best ethnographies I’ve read recently, I’ve come to appreciate the holistic inclusion of the ethnographers’ perspective and experience of their time in the field. Considering one’s self in relation/correlation to field work can create what anthropologist Bruno Latour has termed a more “symmetrical anthropology.” 

#Conclusion

As we compressed our photographs into text-based descriptions, numbers and bright, pastel coloured spheres, we learned much about the meaning and purpose of photo making and, considered that these may not be photographs at all. 

Among photos of cats lounging in sinks, dogs in Halloween costumes and posters advertising lectures by award-winning authors, we found images made with sheer utility. Many of the pictures in both of our libraries were brief documentations of discreet moments form our every day lives are sent directly to one or two individuals to communicate something, the equivalent of a visual text enabled by the instantaneous availability of cameras. Our libraries were also replete with images of information. Images of posters for community events or our licence plates are blatant examples of how photographs are supplanting not only short hand notes taken on pen and paper, but perhaps our own memories, as they become far too bloated with passwords and usernames to remember one more. Translating our data into a visualization of another kind illustrated the process and purpose of contemporary photography and the potential inherent in translating it into another form of meaning. 

We ultimately decided to pursue a self-derived data set after having challenges with neatly adopting data from other locations (data sets on national student debt averages from Statscan were also just too depressing to use mid-semester). Other data didn’t neatly fit into the format required by RAW to morph it into an intelligible visualization and we didn’t want to produce something inaccurate. While a variety of data sets from Statscan and even the monthly sales of Marvel were intriguing opportunities for visualization, developing our own information was a worthy investment of time. It gave us a sense of the meticulous process required in the construction of larger data sets for future research and more complex visualizations from start to finish. Focusing on our own photography ultimately allowed us to objectively consider the contemporary use of a media that is used so broadly and increasingly without conscious thought. Finally, and perhaps most importantly it also allowed us to invest personal meaning in the process of creating data sets and their abstract visualizations visualizations, an element of the human experience that can quickly go missing in the aggregate.
